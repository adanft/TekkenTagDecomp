# Decompiling (working notes)

The goal is C that compiles to the same bytes as the original with the game's own compiler. How the build
compiles a C file and links it: [build.md](build.md), "C files".

## Compiler

| | |
|---|---|
| Compiler | Sony ee-gcc `2.9-ee-991111-01` (decomp.me archive `ee-gcc2.9-991111-01`; `cc1` SHA-1 `4af299f2cebfa6043e876b34af7f8173d99c43c7`) |
| Flags | `-O2 -fno-strength-reduce -ffast-math` |
| `-G` | `-G8`, the compiler's default (see "Small data" below for the open part) |
| Language | C (the driver's `-lang-c`; the preprocessor is built into `cc1`) |
| Driver use | `ee-gcc ... -S` only; the project's gas assembles the output behind `include/gcc_prelude.inc` |

The executable was built on 2000-11-01 with Sony libraries 1.6.x, yet its code comes from a compiler dated
1999-11-11: the 2.96 compiler of the same SDK generation (`2.96-ee-001003-1`) does not produce it.

### What identifies it (2026-10-18)

Five game functions were written in C and compiled with every Linux ee-gcc of decomp.me, assembled with the
project's gas and compared instruction by instruction with the original. "diff" is the number of differing
instructions with `-O2 -fno-strength-reduce -ffast-math` (`-G8`, `-G0` for the last one); `-` means the output
does not even assemble.

| Function | Shape | 990721 | 991111 | 991111-01 | 991111a | 2.96-ee-001003-1 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `func_00340000` | `x * 0x30` index, store loop, call | 11 | 0 | **0** | 0 | 20 |
| `func_00340AF0` | `sqrtf(dx*dx + dy*dy) <= r` | - | 9 | **0** | 9 | 0 |
| `func_00343278` | busy-wait on a register | - | 0 | **0** | 0 | 2 |
| `func_00341AE8` | five calls, tail call | 0 | 0 | **0** | 0 | 5 |
| `func_00342360` | table lookup with a default | 0 | 0 | **0** | 0 | 13 |

Only 991111-01 matches all five. The evidence, from the most to the least specific:

- **Two nops in front of every `div.s` and `sqrt.s`.** All 268 `div.s` of the executable have them. 991111-01
  emits them for both; 991111 and 991111a (which reports the version 991111-01 too, with the same function
  sizes in its `cc1`) omit them and move `div.s` / `sqrt.s` into delay slots; 990721 emits `c.ole.s`, which the
  R5900 does not have.
- **Multiplication by a constant with `mult`**: `x * 0x30` is `li 0x30 / mult` (the R5900's three-operand
  `mult`) in every 2.9 compiler; 2.96 turns it into shifts and adds.
- **Loops are not strength-reduced**: `for (i = 0; i < 27; i++) a[i] = v;` keeps the index (`sll / addu /
  slti`). Plain `-O2` reverses it into a down-counting pointer loop, so the game was built with
  `-fno-strength-reduce`. `-O1` gives the loop shape but no scheduling, which the original has.
- **`sqrtf` without the errno fallback**: the original has a bare `sqrt.s`; without `-ffast-math` the compiler
  adds a `c.eq.s` check and a call to `sqrtf` (24 differences). One function so far; confirm on more float
  code.
- Short loops padded with nops by the compiler (`lw / andi / nop / nop / nop / bnez`, the R5900 short-loop
  erratum), `move` written as `daddu`, `beql / break 7` division traps, functions aligned to 8 with a nop: all
  as the 991111-01 output.

Also tried: plain `-O2` (8 differences in `func_00340000`, the reversed loop), `-O1` (no scheduling: 16, 2, 0,
4 and 7 differences), `-O3` (same output as `-O2` on these five), and `-G0` against `-G8` (no change for the
first four).
The decomp.me archives `ee-gcc2.95.2-273a`, `2.95.2-274`, `2.95.3-*` (SN Systems builds) and `mwcps2-*`
(Metrowerks) are Windows programs and were not run: the section layout (`.lit4`, `.reginfo`, `.DVP.ovlytab`)
is Sony's GNU toolchain, and the 991111-01 matches leave no room for them.

The other compilers stay in `tools/compilers/` when installed for such checks; the build uses only 991111-01.

## Assembler prelude (include/gcc_prelude.inc)

The compiler leaves part of the encoding to the assembler. The game's assembler (1999-2000) behaved like the
modern gas in nearly everything, including filling delay slots in reorder mode and the hazard nop after an FPU
compare (`c.le.s / nop / bc1t` is in the original). Four instructions differ, each checked against original
bytes:

| Compiler writes | Original | Modern gas | Prelude |
|---|---|---|---|
| `move $4,$5` | `daddu` | `or` | macro to `daddu` |
| `break 7` | code in bits 6-15 (`0x000001CD`) | code in bits 16-25 | `.word` |
| `cvt.w.s $f2,$f1` | function 0x24 (`0x460008A4`) | refused for the R5900 | `.word` |
| `sqrt.s $f12,$f12` | operand in the ft field (`0x460C0304`) | operand in fs | `.word` |

The prelude is also read in front of `INCLUDE_ASM` code. `break`, `cvt.w.s` and `sqrt.s` become data, so gas
never moves them into a delay slot; the compiler only emits them inside `.set noreorder` blocks or where nothing
moves, so this has not mattered yet.

The output is assembled with `-mabi=o64`: with `-mabi=eabi` gas expands address macros (`la`, `addu` with an
immediate) to `daddiu`, the original has `addiu`. The ABI tag is then set to EABI64 (`configure.py --eabi64`).

## Small data (`-G`)

Both kinds of access exist close together. `func_00340070` reaches `D_005F6780` in `.sdata` and
`func_00342E38` its float constants in `.lit4` through `$gp`, which needs `-G` of at least 4 for the compiler
and the assembler. `func_00342360` stores to `D_0046B254` in `.data` with `lui / sw`: with `-G8` an
`extern int` would be reached through `$gp`, so that file was built with `-G0` or declared the variable with a
type larger than 8 bytes (or without a size). `-G8` is the build default; `G_FLAGS` in `configure.py` sets
another value for a path prefix once a file shows which one it needs.

## Matching notes

- Float constants fold bit-exactly in the compiler: `1.0f / 2046.0f` and `1.0f / 32767.0f` give the original
  `.lit4` words.
- The order of independent loads and stores comes from the source: `func_003403C8` (reads three floats of a
  struct, writes them out in another order) and `func_00342E38` (stores to VU0 memory) differ only in that so
  far.
- A store to the same global in both branches of an `if` matched only as one store after the `if/else`
  (`v = cond ? a : b; g = v;`), not as two stores (`func_00342360`).
- `sqrtf` needs a prototype (`float sqrtf(float);`); with `-ffast-math` the compiler inlines it.

## Decompiled so far

| Function | File | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `func_00340000` | `src/340000.c` | fills 27 floats from a 0x30-byte record and calls `func_00357258` |
| `func_00340AF0` | `src/340000.c` | point within a radius |

`src/340000.c` covers 0x340000-0x340B30; the nine functions between those two are `INCLUDE_ASM`.
